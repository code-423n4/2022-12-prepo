Is this the documentation for the contract/

?


[12/09/2022 23:42] mlohc137
Ah no, documentation about the core product on our website is out-of-date. The architecture has significantly changed since we wrote that documentation for our first audit in March.


[12/09/2022 23:43] mlohc137
I have prepared a sort of bird's eye view of the major components in the README, and also the majority of our documentation is within our interfaces


[12/09/2022 23:43] ladboy233
ok thanks.

Can we submit working foundry testcases as PoC?


[12/10/2022 06:31] KingNFT#8007
hardhat is too slow


[12/10/2022 06:45] Parth#7949
```js
function send(address recipient, uint256 unconvertedAmount) external override onlyAllowedMsgSenders {
    uint256 scaledPrice = (_price.get() * _priceMultiplier) / MULTIPLIER_DENOMINATOR;     if (scaledPrice <= _scaledPriceLowerBound) return;
    uint256 outputAmount = (unconvertedAmount * _outputTokenDecimalsFactor) / scaledPrice;
    if (outputAmount == 0) return;
    if (outputAmount > _outputToken.balanceOf(address(this))) return;
    _outputToken.transfer(recipient, outputAmount);
  }
```

Can anyone explain what does the first 3 line of above function does?


[12/10/2022 07:08] ne0n239
@mlohc137 can you please add me as a friend so that I can DM u?


[12/10/2022 08:10] mlohc137
I've accepted all requests and also opened DMs up!


[12/10/2022 08:11] mlohc137
I think this is fine, since testing framework shouldn't intefere with a concept being demonstrated


[12/10/2022 08:12] mlohc137
So this is going to be used to issue `PPO` tokens to reimburse users who are charged fees for using our platform. This scaling multiplier is a way for us to alter the amount being sent without altering the price oracle.

The price oracle is needed because the fee is going to be in some other token amount (`USDC` most likely) and needs the price to determine the conversion rate for how much `PPO` token to issue for reimbursement of the fee.


[12/10/2022 08:43] KingNFT#8007
Is there an oracle example, can we treat it as a typical chain link oracle reporting PPO/USD price with 8 decimals such as 123456789 representing $1.23456789 per PPO token

[12/10/2022 09:42] koolexc
is the documentation out of date for the general concept of the product  as well or is it only for the architecture?


[12/10/2022 11:21] road220
@0xdeadbeef0x , any chance to dm you?


[12/10/2022 11:26] koolexc
@mlohc137 can I dm you?


[12/10/2022 11:40] prexavier
it could be any arbitrary price, e.g. fixed or dynamic. we are using FixedUintValue.sol initially


[12/10/2022 11:40] prexavier
general concept is the same, but for the latest code + architecture see the readme / documentation in interfaces

[12/10/2022 11:41] prexavier
sure


[12/10/2022 11:44] prexavier
all the current tests pass, so for speed purposes if you're trying to test a specific behaviour probably best to only test on a specific test file + comment out all tests except the ones that are relevant for you (including any you write yourself)


[12/10/2022 11:55] Parth#7949
@Xavier | prePO 🔮 what is long token and short token?


[12/10/2022 12:00] Parth#7949
What is the significance of `Deposit`, `Withdraw` and `ManagerWithdraw` in collateral token when there is `mint` and `redeem` functionality in `PrePOMarket`? Can you explain how both of these pieces fit together?

@Xavier | prePO 🔮 
Could you please explain what's the use of NFTScoreRequirement in a real world scenario?


[12/10/2022 14:08] Parth#7949
Is there any detailed explanation/docs/blogs/videos of what this is trying to achieve? Am not able to visualize bigger picture


[12/10/2022 14:11] prexavier
e.g. if you own certain nfts w/ enough total score, you can access a guarded launch of the platform


[12/10/2022 14:12] prexavier
for bigger picture you can read the rest of the docs


[12/10/2022 15:17] aviggiano
hello
can someone point me to the documentation explaining how `NFTScoreRequirement` is used?

@Xavier | prePO 🔮 What type of account typically holds the various roles defined in the contracts?


[12/10/2022 18:23] prexavier
Most likely a governance multisig


[12/10/2022 18:24] trustminimised
But not necessarily?


[12/10/2022 18:43] prexavier
Could also be a contract etc. Can assume the role holders are secure/trustworthy


[12/11/2022 00:28] aviggiano
Started a thread.

`AccountList.sol` is under scope? Not included in any section and it was in a folder where all the contrats are scoped, but this file seems forgotten


[12/11/2022 11:42] prexavier
i believe it was already audited in a previous audit, that's why

I am getting a lot of questions about the nature of NFTs being used as criteria for `NFTScoreRequirement`, so going to leave the answer here for everyone. We will be using soulbound Galxe NFTs that are issued by PrePO for past participation in various promotional programs and token sales.
